# Image Boundary Extraction

This project implements boundary extraction from images using Java. It demonstrates two methods: 8-adjacency and m-adjacency for boundary detection. The results are displayed using Swing and saved as PNG files.

## Features
- Load an image and extract its boundary using two different adjacency methods.
- Display the original and processed images side by side.
- Save the resulting images to disk.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- ImageIO library for image processing
